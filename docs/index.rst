CirrusStream
================
CirrusStream is a near real-time streaming and ETL software program
designed for client to edge communication in unstable network environments.
Files are fetched using a ssh protocol from secure edge nodes into CirruStream.
Data files are then cleaned and factored into two types of data groups, a 'bronze' log-level record
of raw json data and a 'silver' record which has been standardized.
